Every scan produces a score from 0 to 100. The score reflects how many unique rules your project triggers, weighted by severity.

## Calculation

```
score = max(0, round(100 - penalties))
```

Where penalties are:

| Severity | Penalty per unique rule |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Error    | 1.5 points              |
| Warning  | 0.75 points             |

The score is based on **unique rules triggered**, not the total count of diagnostics. If the same rule fires on 10 files, it only counts once.

## Labels

| Score  | Label      |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 75–100 | Great      |
| 50–74  | Needs work |
| 0–49   | Critical   |

## Example

A project with 2 error rules and 8 warning rules:

```
penalty = (2 × 1.5) + (8 × 0.75) = 3 + 6 = 9
score = max(0, round(100 - 9)) = 91 → Great
```

## Share your score

After running Vercel Doctor, your score is available on a shareable page with social sharing buttons and an embeddable badge.

### Badge

Add a badge to your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![Vercel Doctor](https://www.vercel-doctor.com/share/badge?s=91)](https://www.vercel-doctor.com/share?s=91)
```

### API

You can also calculate scores programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.vercel-doctor.com/api/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"diagnostics": [...]}'
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "score": 91,
  "label": "Great"
}
```

The `/api/estimate-score` endpoint estimates what your score would be after fixing issues, using estimated fix rates of 85% for errors and 80% for warnings.
