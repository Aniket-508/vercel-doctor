Vercel Doctor can be installed as a skill for AI coding assistants. Once installed, your AI assistant will automatically suggest running Vercel Doctor after making changes to Next.js projects.

## One-line install

```bash
npx skills add vercel-doctor
```

Or install via curl:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vercel-doctor.com/install-skill.sh | bash
```

## Supported tools

The installer auto-detects and installs for all supported tools on your system:

| Tool        | Skill location                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/vercel-doctor/`              |
| Amp Code    | `~/.config/amp/skills/vercel-doctor/`          |
| Cursor      | `~/.cursor/skills/vercel-doctor/`              |
| OpenCode    | `~/.config/opencode/skills/vercel-doctor/`     |
| Windsurf    | `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/vercel-doctor/`  |
| Gemini CLI  | `~/.gemini/skills/vercel-doctor/`              |
| Codex       | `~/.codex/skills/vercel-doctor/`               |

The installer also adds the skill to your project's `.agents/` directory for project-level context.

## What the skill does

When activated, the AI assistant will:

1. Know about Vercel Doctor and what it scans for
2. Suggest running `npx -y vercel-doctor@latest . --verbose --diff` after changes
3. Focus on fixing issues that reduce function execution time and invocations first
