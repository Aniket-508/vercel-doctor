title: Dead Code
description: Rules that detect unused files, exports, and types in your codebase.
---

Dead code detection is powered by [Knip](https://knip.dev). Unused code bloats your bundle, slows cold starts, and increases deployment size — all of which translate to higher Vercel costs.

You can disable dead code detection entirely with `--no-dead-code` or `"deadCode": false` in your config file.

## knip/files

<Callout type="warn">Warning · `knip/files`</Callout>

Detects files that are not imported by any other file in the project.

**Why it matters:** Unused files are still deployed and parsed during builds. They increase cold start time by adding to the module graph.

**Fix:** Delete the file, or if it's intentionally standalone, add it to your Knip config's entry patterns.

## knip/exports

<Callout type="warn">Warning · `knip/exports`</Callout>

Detects exported symbols (functions, variables, classes) that are never imported anywhere.

**Why it matters:** Unused exports add dead code to your bundle. Tree-shaking doesn't always eliminate them, especially in server-side code.

**Fix:** Remove the `export` keyword, or delete the symbol if it's no longer needed.

## knip/types

<Callout type="warn">Warning · `knip/types`</Callout>

Detects exported TypeScript types and interfaces that are never referenced.

**Fix:** Remove unused type exports.

---

## knip/duplicates

<Callout type="warn">Warning · `knip/duplicates`</Callout>

Detects the same symbol exported from multiple files.

**Why it matters:** Duplicate exports create ambiguity and can lead to importing from the wrong file, pulling in more code than necessary.

**Fix:** Consolidate duplicates into a single export location.
