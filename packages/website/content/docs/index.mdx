description: Reduce your Vercel bill by scanning your Next.js codebase for costly patterns.
---

import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

Vercel Doctor is a specialized health check tool for Next.js projects deployed on Vercel. It scans your codebase for patterns that inflate your bill — function duration, uncached routes, unoptimized images, and more — then gives you a score out of 100 with actionable fixes.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

<Step>
### Run on your project

```bash
npx -y vercel-doctor@latest .
```

That's it. No install, no config. It scans your codebase and outputs a score with diagnostics.

</Step>

<Step>
### Fix the issues

Each diagnostic includes a help message explaining what to change and why. Fix the highest-impact rules first — errors before warnings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Re-run to verify

```bash
npx -y vercel-doctor@latest . --diff
```

Use `--diff` on feature branches to scan only the files you changed.

</Step>

</Steps>

## What it checks

Vercel Doctor runs two analysis passes in parallel:

1. **Billing lint** — AST-based and pattern-based rules that detect costly Next.js and Vercel patterns
2. **Dead code detection** — finds unused files, exports, and types that bloat your bundle and slow cold starts

### Rule categories

| Category                                             | Rules | What it catches                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Function Duration](/docs/rules/function-duration)   | 3     | Sequential awaits, blocking logging, non-parallel I/O                                      |
| [Caching](/docs/rules/caching)                       | 6     | `force-dynamic`, missing cache policies, `no-store` fetches, side effects in GET handlers  |
| [Invocations](/docs/rules/invocations)               | 2     | Client-side fetching in pages, aggressive link prefetching                                 |
| [Image Optimization](/docs/rules/image-optimization) | 4     | Global `unoptimized`, missing `sizes`, broad remote patterns, SVG without `unoptimized`    |
| [Platform](/docs/rules/platform)                     | 8     | Edge heavy imports, cron jobs, Bun runtime, Fluid Compute, deploy archive, Turbopack cache |
| [Dead Code](/docs/rules/dead-code)                   | 4     | Unused files, exports, types, and duplicates                                               |

## Features
